## Best Practices for Stable Job Execution

Building jobs at scale requires defensive design. Here's what we recommend:

### Always Provide Fallbacks
 Your templates should gracefully handle empty or missing values.

    | Layer Type | Best Practice                               |
    | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | Text       | Set a default like "(Missing Title)"        |
    | Image      | Use a neutral brand logo or placeholder     |
    | Audio      | Default to silent.mp3 or fallback narration |

    In After Effects, use `if` expressions or fallback layers hidden by default.

### Implement Retry Logic
  Sometimes jobs can fail due to:

    - Transient render errors
    - Temporary asset access issues
    - Internal AE limitations

  You can retry a failed job with the exact same payload, or:

    - Build retries into your webhook processor
    - Query job status with `GET /jobs/:id` and retry failed states
    - Use a queue system that retries `status = failed`

### Validate Assets Before Submit
  Before rendering, always validate:

    - `composition` name exists (from template introspection)
    - `layerName` matches exactly
    - URLs for assets return a `200 OK`
    - Font dependencies have been preloaded

### Use Webhooks to Avoid Polling
  Set a `webhook.url` so your system is notified when jobs complete.

    ```json
    "webhook": {
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/render-done",
      "method": "POST"
    }
    ```

  This saves on polling requests and scales better across high volume workflows.

  
## Security Note

For cloud execution, some postrender modules require credentials (AWS/GCP keys). You must securely manage these â€” avoid committing them to version control or exposing them in public requests.

If you need native integration with secure uploads, consider using Nexrender Cloud's built-in **webhooks \+ presigned URLs** instead.
