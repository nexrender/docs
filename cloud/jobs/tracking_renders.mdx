This guide explains how to track the status of a render job, either by polling the API or configuring a webhook for real-time delivery.

## Job Status Lifecycle

| Status      | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `queued`    | Job is waiting to be picked up by render engine |
| `rendering` | Currently being processed                       |
| `done`      | Successfully rendered; `output.url` available   |
| `failed`    | Encountered an error (see `error` field)        |

## Webhook Notifications (Recommended)

Instead of polling, you can configure a **webhook** in your job payload:

```json
"webhook": {
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com/render-status",
  "method": "POST"
}
```

When the job completes (success or failure), Nexrender Cloud will `POST` to the specified URL with a job payload.

<CodeGroup>

```json Example Webhook Payload (Success)
{
  "id": "01JTRDF7HCR8QAHYW8GPCP4S9Y",
  "status": "done",
  "output": {
    "url": "https://nexrender-output.s3.amazonaws.com/job.mp4"
  }
}
```
```json Example Webhook Payload (Failure)
{
  "id": "01JTRDF7HCR8QAHYW8GPCP4S9Y",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": {
    "message": "Layer 'title' not found in composition 'main'",
    "code": "LAYER_NOT_FOUND"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Make sure your webhook endpoint is idempotent and returns a 200 OK response.
</Note>

## Webhook Retry Logic

If your server is temporarily unavailable, Nexrender Cloud will retry delivery up to **3 times** with exponential backoff.

To maximize reliability:

- Respond with `200 OK` immediately (even if processing async)
- Avoid timeouts â€” webhook POSTs should complete in under 2 seconds
- Log and audit webhook deliveries

## Test with Postman

Use the `Mock Server` feature to test payload reception or replay.

## Summary

- Use `GET /jobs/:id` to poll job state manually
- Use `webhook.url` to receive async status notifications
- Ensure your webhook endpoints are reliable and secure
