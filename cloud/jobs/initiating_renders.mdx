## Submit the Job

Submit the job with a simple POST request:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Post Request
curl -X POST https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @job-payload.json
```


```javascript Inline
curl -X POST https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "template": {
      "id": "01JTGM9GCR71JV7EJYDF45QAFD",
      "composition": "main"
    },
    "assets": [
      {
        "type": "data",
        "layerName": "title",
        "property": "Source Text",
        "value": "Hello World!"
      }
    ],
    "preview": false
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Job Request Internals

| Field                  | Type    | Required | Description                         |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `template.id`          | string  | ✅        | ID of the template created earlier  |
| `template.composition` | string  | ✅        | Composition to render               |
| `assets`               | array   | ✅        | List of asset overrides             |
| `preview`              | boolean | ❌        | Set `true` for fast low-res preview |
| `webhook.url`          | string  | ❌        | Callback endpoint for job status    |
| `webhook.method`       | string  | ❌        | Typically `POST`                    |

Each asset object must have:

- `type`: `data`, `image`, `audio`, `video`
- `layerName`: exact layer name from the template
- `property`: like `"Source Text"` or `"Source Name"`
- `value` or `src`: depending on asset type

> You can inspect available `layerName`s using `GET /templates/:id`

## Preview Mode vs Final Render

Nexrender Cloud supports two rendering modes:

| Mode             | Description                                          | Use Case                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `preview: true`  | Low-res render, fast execution, watermark (optional) | Testing template structure |
| `preview: false` | Full-quality final render, slower, billed normally   | Production rendering       |

### When to Use `preview: true`

Use preview mode when:

- Verifying that `layerName` overrides are correct
- Testing a new template or composition
- Integrating webhooks or downstream automation
- You want to run a batch sanity check before scaling

```json
{
  "preview": true
}
```

Previews render faster and are cheaper on infrastructure resources. If your template is broken (bad expression, missing font, wrong composition), it's better to catch it here.

> You can build an internal CI pipeline that runs preview renders against all newly uploaded templates.

## Targeting Layers in Alternate Compositions

By default, assets are injected into the composition defined in the `template.composition` field.

However, you can override this on a per-asset basis using the `composition` key inside the asset definition.

This is useful when you want to render a specific comp (like `main`), but modify a layer in a supporting comp (like `main2`).

#### Example

```json
{
  "template": {
    "id": "01JTGM9GCR71JV7EJYDF45QAFD",
    "composition": "main"
  },
  "assets": [
    {
      "type": "data",
      "layerName": "title",
      "composition": "main2",
      "property": "Source Text",
      "value": "Hello World!"
    }
  ],
  "preview": false
}
```

## Validate the Assets Before Submitting

Before rendering, always validate:

- `composition` name exists (from template introspection)
- `layerName` matches exactly
- URLs for assets return a `200 OK`
- Font dependencies have been preloaded
