Even the best-built templates can fail — especially when working with automation, dynamic data, and After Effects. This guide explains how to detect, interpret, and fix common job errors in Nexrender Cloud.


## Where Errors Appear

When a render job fails, the system sets its status to:

```json
"status": "failed"
```

You can detect this in two ways:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook Delivery">
    If you've defined a webhook, the error will be delivered as a POST request:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "01JTRDF7HCR8QAHYW8GPCP4S9Y",
      "status": "failed",
      "error": {
        "message": "Layer 'title' not found in composition 'main'",
        "code": "LAYER_NOT_FOUND"
      }
    }
    ```
## Manual Polling
    Use the jobs API:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/jobs/JOB_ID \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    Check the returned `status` and `error` fields.

## Common Causes of Render Failures
    | Cause                   | Error Message Example                        | How to Fix                                   |
    | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | **`Invalid layerName`** | `Layer 'subtitle' not found`                 | Check actual layers via `GET /templates/:id` |
    | **Missing composition** | `Composition 'main' not found`               | Verify name when submitting job              |
    | **Missing asset URL**   | `Asset failed to download (403)`             | Double-check `src` links or permissions      |
    | **Font not found**      | `Font 'CustomFont-Bold.ttf' not available`   | Preload font using the Fonts API             |
    | **Broken AE project**   | `Render failed: AE crashed with exit code 1` | Preview manually inside After Effects        |
    | **Expression failure**  | `After Effects expression error at line X`   | Sanitize all dynamic input                   |

    > Tip: Most errors are caused by bad data or structural mismatches between template and job payload.


## Debugging Strategy
### Inspect the Template
    Use the `GET /templates/:id` endpoint to see:

    - Available compositions
    - All dynamic layers \+ property names
    - Font dependencies (if visible)

    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

### Use Preview Mode
    Render the job with `"preview": true`:

    ```json
    {
      "template": { "id": "...", "composition": "main" },
      "preview": true
    }
    ```
This saves time and cost — and reveals most issues (missing layers, layout bugs, expression crashes) before final rendering.
  

### Test Job Payloads with Defaults
    Temporarily reduce your job to a minimal payload with:

    - Static text only
    - No image/audio layers
    - Known good composition

    Once that succeeds, reintroduce dynamic elements incrementally.

## Best Practices for Stability

- **Fetch template metadata** before every job
- Use meaningful `layerName`s and document them internally
- Preload fonts instead of assuming they exist
- Validate URLs before sending render jobs
- Wrap asset layers with fallback expressions inside AE
- Enable webhook retries on your server (at least 3 attempts)
