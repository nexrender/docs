Even the best-built templates can fail — especially when working with automation, dynamic data, and After Effects. This guide explains how to detect, interpret, and fix common job errors in Nexrender Cloud.

## Where Errors Appear

When a render job fails, the system sets its status to:

```json
"status": "failed"
```

You can detect this in two ways:

### Webhook Delivery

If you’ve defined a webhook, the error will be delivered as a POST request:

```json
{
  "id": "01JTRDF7HCR8QAHYW8GPCP4S9Y",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": {
    "message": "Layer 'title' not found in composition 'main'",
    "code": "LAYER_NOT_FOUND"
  }
}
```

### Manual Polling

Use the jobs API:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/jobs/JOB_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Check the returned `status` and `error` fields.

## Common Causes of Render Failures

| Cause                   | Error Message Example                        | How to Fix                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **`Invalid layerName`** | `Layer 'subtitle' not found`                 | Check actual layers via `GET /templates/:id` |
| **Missing composition** | `Composition 'main' not found`               | Verify name when submitting job              |
| **Missing asset URL**   | `Asset failed to download (403)`             | Double-check `src` links or permissions      |
| **Font not found**      | `Font 'CustomFont-Bold.ttf' not available`   | Preload font using the Fonts API             |
| **Broken AE project**   | `Render failed: AE crashed with exit code 1` | Preview manually inside After Effects        |
| **Expression failure**  | `After Effects expression error at line X`   | Sanitize all dynamic input                   |

> Tip: Most errors are caused by bad data or structural mismatches between template and job payload.

## Debugging Strategy

### 1. Inspect the Template

Use the `GET /templates/:id` endpoint to see:

- Available compositions
- All dynamic layers \+ property names
- Font dependencies (if visible)

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

---

### 2. Use Preview Mode

Render the job with `"preview": true`:

```json
{
  "template": { "id": "...", "composition": "main" },
  "preview": true
}
```

This saves time and cost — and reveals most issues (missing layers, layout bugs, expression crashes) before final rendering.

---

### 3. Test Job Payloads with Defaults

Temporarily reduce your job to a minimal payload with:

- Static text only
- No image/audio layers
- Known good composition

Once that succeeds, reintroduce dynamic elements incrementally.

---

## Best Practices for Stability

- **Fetch template metadata** before every job
- Use meaningful `layerName`s and document them internally
- Preload fonts instead of assuming they exist
- Validate URLs before sending render jobs
- Wrap asset layers with fallback expressions inside AE
- Enable webhook retries on your server (at least 3 attempts)
