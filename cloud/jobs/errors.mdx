Even the best-built templates can fail — especially when working with automation, dynamic data, and After Effects. This guide explains how to detect, interpret, and fix common job errors in Nexrender Cloud.

    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.

  <Accordion title="Preview changes" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.

    1. Install the
       [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
       documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
       `docs.json` is): `mintlify dev`

    <Note>
      If you’re currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      `mintlify upgrade`
      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.

## Where Errors Appear

When a render job fails, the system sets its status to:

```json
"status": "failed"
```

You can detect this in two ways:

### Webhook Delivery

If you’ve defined a webhook, the error will be delivered as a POST request:

```json
{
  "id": "01JTRDF7HCR8QAHYW8GPCP4S9Y",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": {
    "message": "Layer 'title' not found in composition 'main'",
    "code": "LAYER_NOT_FOUND"
  }
}
```

### Manual Polling

Use the jobs API:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/jobs/JOB_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Check the returned `status` and `error` fields.

## Common Causes of Render Failures

| Cause                   | Error Message Example                        | How to Fix                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **`Invalid layerName`** | `Layer 'subtitle' not found`                 | Check actual layers via `GET /templates/:id` |
| **Missing composition** | `Composition 'main' not found`               | Verify name when submitting job              |
| **Missing asset URL**   | `Asset failed to download (403)`             | Double-check `src` links or permissions      |
| **Font not found**      | `Font 'CustomFont-Bold.ttf' not available`   | Preload font using the Fonts API             |
| **Broken AE project**   | `Render failed: AE crashed with exit code 1` | Preview manually inside After Effects        |
| **Expression failure**  | `After Effects expression error at line X`   | Sanitize all dynamic input                   |

> Tip: Most errors are caused by bad data or structural mismatches between template and job payload.

---

## Debugging Strategy

### 1. Inspect the Template

Use the `GET /templates/:id` endpoint to see:

- Available compositions
- All dynamic layers \+ property names
- Font dependencies (if visible)

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

---

### 2. Use Preview Mode

Render the job with `"preview": true`:

```json
{
  "template": { "id": "...", "composition": "main" },
  "preview": true
}
```

This saves time and cost — and reveals most issues (missing layers, layout bugs, expression crashes) before final rendering.

---

### 3. Test Job Payloads with Defaults

Temporarily reduce your job to a minimal payload with:

- Static text only
- No image/audio layers
- Known good composition

Once that succeeds, reintroduce dynamic elements incrementally.

---

## Best Practices for Stability

- **Fetch template metadata** before every job
- Use meaningful `layerName`s and document them internally
- Preload fonts instead of assuming they exist
- Validate URLs before sending render jobs
- Wrap asset layers with fallback expressions inside AE
- Enable webhook retries on your server (at least 3 attempts)
