Once your template is uploaded and inspected, you can submit a **render job** using the Nexrender Cloud API.

A render job ties together:

- A template
- A specific composition inside that template
- A set of dynamic assets (text, image, audio, etc.)
- Optional preview/render flags and webhooks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Is a Render Job?">
    Each job is a self-contained instruction set telling Nexrender Cloud how to render a video from a specific template.

    Jobs are **idempotent**, meaning the same payload will always produce the same output — unless your template changes.

    You must specify:

    - `template.id`: the template to use
    - `template.composition`: the comp to render
    - `assets`: an array of overrides (layerName \+ value)
    - `preview`: (optional) for low-res fast rendering
    - `webhook`: (optional) for real-time status notification
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Job Payload Structure">
    Here's what a minimal payload looks like:

    ```json
    {
      "template": {
        "id": "01JTGM9GCR71JV7EJYDF45QAFD",
        "composition": "main"
      },
      "assets": [
        {
          "type": "data",
          "layerName": "title",
          "property": "Source Text",
          "value": "Hello World!"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    You can extend it with more assets and a webhook:

    ```json
    {
      "template": {
        "id": "01JTGM9GCR71JV7EJYDF45QAFD",
        "composition": "main"
      },
      "assets": [
        {
          "type": "data",
          "layerName": "title",
          "property": "Source Text",
          "value": "Custom Title"
        },
        {
          "type": "image",
          "layerName": "logo",
          "property": "Source Name",
          "src": "https://example.com/logo.png"
        },
        {
          "type": "audio",
          "layerName": "music",
          "property": "Source Name",
          "src": "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
        }
      ],
      "webhook": {
        "url": "https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/render-complete",
        "method": "POST"
      },
      "preview": false
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supported Asset Types">
    Nexrender Cloud lets you customize your After Effects templates by injecting different types of assets during render time. These assets are defined in the `assets` array of your render job payload.

    Each asset must include a `type`, and typically a `layerName`, `src`, or parameters depending on its function.

    #### `data` — Text Override

    Use to change text in a composition layer.

    ```json
    {
      "type": "data",
      "layerName": "title",
      "property": "Source Text",
      "value": "Hello World!"
    }
    ```

    #### `image` — Replace Image

    ```json
    {
      "type": "image",
      "src": "https://cdn.yourapp.com/assets/avatar.jpg",
      "layerName": "Avatar"
    }
    ```

    #### `audio` — Inject Audio

    ```json
    {
      "type": "audio",
      "src": "https://yourcdn.com/audio/intro.mp3",
      "layerName": "VoiceTrack"
    }
    ```

    #### `video` — Replace Footage

    ```json
    {
      "type": "video",
      "src": "https://cdn.site.com/introclip.mp4",
      "layerName": "FootageLayer"
    }
    ```

    #### `script` — Inject JSX Code

    ```json
    {
      "type": "script",
      "src": "data:text/plain,app.project.timeDisplayType=TimeDisplayType.TIMECODE;"
    }
    ```

    - Can also point to remote `.jsx` files
    - Scripts are executed before render begins

    #### `function` — Declarative Action Blocks

    Functions allow structured operations like setting text via high-level parameters.

    ```json
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "nx:text-params-set",
      "params": {
        "layerName": "Main_Title",
        "textValue": "Hello from Main Comp"
      }
    }
    ```

    You can also target a specific composition:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "nx:text-params-set",
      "params": {
        "composition": "Precomp_1",
        "layerName": "Sub_Title",
        "textValue": "Text inside Precomp"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Targeting Layers in Alternate Compositions">
    By default, assets are injected into the composition defined in the `template.composition` field.

    However, you can override this on a per-asset basis using the `composition` key inside the asset definition.

    This is useful when you want to render a specific comp (like `main`), but modify a layer in a supporting comp (like `main2`).

    #### Example

    ```json
    {
      "template": {
        "id": "01JTGM9GCR71JV7EJYDF45QAFD",
        "composition": "main"
      },
      "assets": [
        {
          "type": "data",
          "layerName": "title",
          "composition": "main2",
          "property": "Source Text",
          "value": "Hello World!"
        }
      ],
      "preview": false
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    ### Expected Response

    ```json
    {
      "id": "01JTRDF7HCR8QAHYW8GPCP4S9Y",
      "status": "queued",
      "output": null,
      "createdAt": "2025-05-14T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
    ```

    ## Job Payload Reference

    | Field                  | Type    | Required | Description                         |
    | ---------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
    | `template.id`          | string  | ✅        | ID of the template created earlier  |
    | `template.composition` | string  | ✅        | Composition to render               |
    | `assets`               | array   | ✅        | List of asset overrides             |
    | `preview`              | boolean | ❌        | Set `true` for fast low-res preview |
    | `webhook.url`          | string  | ❌        | Callback endpoint for job status    |
    | `webhook.method`       | string  | ❌        | Typically `POST`                    |

    Each asset object must have:

    - `type`: `data`, `image`, `audio`, `video`
    - `layerName`: exact layer name from the template
    - `property`: like `"Source Text"` or `"Source Name"`
    - `value` or `src`: depending on asset type

    > You can inspect available `layerName`s using `GET /templates/:id`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Post-Actions (Optional)">
    Once a render job completes, Nexrender Cloud can automatically run one or more **post-actions**.

    These actions allow you to:

    - Upload the final video to external storage
    - Trigger external processes (e.g. Slack, CMS, Zapier)
    - Transcode or rename the result
    - Chain workflows (e.g. send to TTS or narration engine)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview Mode vs Final Render">
    Nexrender Cloud supports two rendering modes:

    | Mode             | Description                                          | Use Case                   |
    | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
    | `preview: true`  | Low-res render, fast execution, watermark (optional) | Testing template structure |
    | `preview: false` | Full-quality final render, slower, billed normally   | Production rendering       |

    ### When to Use `preview: true`

    Use preview mode when:

    - Verifying that `layerName` overrides are correct
    - Testing a new template or composition
    - Integrating webhooks or downstream automation
    - You want to run a batch sanity check before scaling

    ```json
    {
      "preview": true
    }
    ```

    Previews render faster and are cheaper on infrastructure resources. If your template is broken (bad expression, missing font, wrong composition), it's better to catch it here.

    > You can build an internal CI pipeline that runs preview renders against all newly uploaded templates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices for Stable Job Execution

Building jobs at scale requires defensive design. Here's what we recommend:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Provide Fallbacks">
    Your templates should gracefully handle empty or missing values.

    | Layer Type | Best Practice                               |
    | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | Text       | Set a default like "(Missing Title)"        |
    | Image      | Use a neutral brand logo or placeholder     |
    | Audio      | Default to silent.mp3 or fallback narration |

    In After Effects, use `if` expressions or fallback layers hidden by default.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Implement Retry Logic">
    Sometimes jobs can fail due to:

    - Transient render errors
    - Temporary asset access issues
    - Internal AE limitations

    You can retry a failed job with the exact same payload, or:

    - Build retries into your webhook processor
    - Query job status with `GET /jobs/:id` and retry failed states
    - Use a queue system that retries `status = failed`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate Assets Before Submit">
    Before rendering, always validate:

    - `composition` name exists (from template introspection)
    - `layerName` matches exactly
    - URLs for assets return a `200 OK`
    - Font dependencies have been preloaded
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Webhooks to Avoid Polling">
    Set a `webhook.url` so your system is notified when jobs complete.

    ```json
    "webhook": {
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/render-done",
      "method": "POST"
    }
    ```

    This saves on polling requests and scales better across high volume workflows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clean Up Old Jobs">
    Use `GET /jobs` to review recent activity and optionally clean up old or test jobs that are no longer needed.

    While job output remains accessible after completion, pruning unused entries improves visibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to Add Post-Actions">
    Post-actions are declared in a `postrender` array in the job payload. Each entry defines a `module` (built-in action) and its corresponding `params`.

    ```json
    "postrender": [
      {
        "module": "@nexrender/action-upload",
        "input": "result.mp4",
        "params": {
          "provider": "s3",
          "bucket": "my-bucket",
          "key": "output/final-video.mp4",
          "region": "eu-west-1",
          "accessKey": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
          "secretKey": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    > Not all postrender actions are supported in the cloud. Start with safe actions like upload or webhook-based flows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Common Built-In Modules">
    | Module Name                 | Description                           |
    | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
    | `@nexrender/action-upload`  | Upload to S3, FTP, GCS, etc.          |
    | `@nexrender/action-copy`    | Copy file within the render container |
    | `@nexrender/action-encode`  | Re-encode using ffmpeg                |
    | `@nexrender/action-webhook` | Send a POST request with render info  |
    | `@nexrender/action-cleanup` | Delete project files after render     |

    More examples in [nexrender/actions](https://github.com/nexrender/actions).

    ### Example: Upload to Google Cloud Storage

    ```json
    {
      "module": "@nexrender/action-upload",
      "input": "result.mp4",
      "params": {
        "provider": "gcs",
        "bucket": "nexrender-cloud-videos",
        "key": "jobs/01JABCXYZ/output.mp4",
        "projectId": "my-gcp-project",
        "keyFilename": "/path/to/gcp-service-account.json"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Note

For cloud execution, some postrender modules require credentials (AWS/GCP keys). You must securely manage these — avoid committing them to version control or exposing them in public requests.

If you need native integration with secure uploads, consider using Nexrender Cloud's built-in **webhooks \+ presigned URLs** instead.

<Note>
  For detailed examples of postrender usage, see our Advanced Recipes and OSS repo [nexrender/jobs](https://github.com/inlife/nexrender#job-format).
