Nexrender Cloud allows you to delete templates that are no longer needed. This is useful for:

- Removing test or temporary assets
- Cleaning up deprecated campaign templates
- Managing storage usage in your account


## When Should You Delete a Template?
  You might want to delete a template when:
    - It has been replaced by a newer version
    - It was used for testing and is no longer relevant
    - You’re cleaning up automation clutter in your account

    > Deleting a template **does not affect** existing jobs that already used it. Those jobs remain in the system and their output remains accessible.
  
  
## What Happens After Deletion?
    | Component         | Status                                             |
    | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | Template metadata | Permanently deleted from Nexrender Cloud           |
    | Uploaded file     | Removed from storage (Cloudflare R2 or equivalent) |
    | Associated jobs   | Remain intact — no data loss                       |
    | Rendering         | New jobs using this template will fail with 404    |

    If you attempt to reference a deleted template in a job request, you’ll receive a `404 Template Not Found`.
  
## Edge Cases & Notes
    - You **cannot delete** a template while it's actively rendering.
    - If a template is in `awaiting_upload`, you can delete it immediately.
    - Deletion is **immediate and irreversible** — no soft-delete or recovery options.
    - You can safely delete templates that had webhook or font dependencies — those are not linked permanently.
  
## Suggested Practice
    To keep things clean:
    - Delete unused templates after testing flows
    - Use versioned `displayName`s so you know what’s safe to remove
    - Add deletion as part of your CI teardown if you're creating templates dynamically.
