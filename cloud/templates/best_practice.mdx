Creating reliable, scalable templates for Nexrender Cloud isn’t just about making them render — it’s about making them **repeatable**, **debuggable**, and **collaboration-friendly**.

Here are the key principles we recommend.

## Structure Your Template Archives Carefully

For `.zip` templates:

- Keep the structure **flat** — no top-level folders
- Ensure all assets (images, audio, etc.) are inside the archive
- Place the `.aep` file at the root level of the archive

```text
project.zip
├── MyTemplate.aep
├── assets/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── audio.mp3
```

> This avoids asset path issues and guarantees cross-platform portability.

## Name Layers and Compositions Intelligently

Clear naming of layers and compositions directly improves automation accuracy, debuggability, and developer handoff. Treat your `.aep` or `.mogrt` like a codebase — the structure matters.

### Layer Naming Rules

| Layer Attribute       | Best Practice                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `layerName`           | Use lowercase, short identifiers (`title`, `cta`)   |
| `property`            | Match AE's label exactly (`Source Text`, `Opacity`) |
| Avoid duplicates      | Ensure no two layers in the same comp share a name  |
| Use descriptive types | e.g. `product_image`, `voiceover`, `cta_background` |

> Nexrender requires exact `layerName` matches during job execution. Ambiguity or typos will cause silent render errors or broken outputs.

### Composition Naming Rules

| Composition Type    | Suggested Naming                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Main output comp    | `main`, `final`, `output`, etc.      |
| Variants            | `main_1080p`, `main_instagram`, etc. |
| Reusable partials   | `cta_module`, `intro_block`, etc.    |
| Discarded or hidden | Prefix with `_` (e.g. `_scratchpad`) |

This ensures the `compositions` list returned by the API is clean, predictable, and renderable.

## Nested Compositions: Best Practices

Nested comps are a powerful After Effects feature, but you must use them carefully for cloud automation:

Use Nested Comps To:

- Group logic-heavy modules (e.g. transitions, intro bumpers)
- Encapsulate reusable visual elements (e.g. buttons, tickers)
- Reduce clutter in the main timeline

Avoid Nested Comps If:

- They rely on hard-coded paths or relative asset placement
- They contain dynamic layers you intend to override
- You have deeply nested timelines (\>3 levels) — this can increase AE processing time and complicate debugging

> Keep nested comps clean, flattened when possible, and **treat the top-level comp as your automation interface**.

## Preview Rendering With Dummy Data

Before deploying a template at scale:

- Create a test job with fake but realistic values
- Set `"preview": true` to get a fast low-res render
- Check for missing fonts, broken text, or incorrect layout sizing

This helps catch structural and naming bugs early, especially with deeply nested templates.

## Think Like a Developer \+ Designer

Design with **automation-first principles**:

- Expose only what needs to be dynamic
- Use naming conventions for predictability
- Keep timelines shallow, modular, and reusable
- Organize assets logically inside the project and `.zip`

This makes your After Effects templates act like **parameterized functions**, not fragile, one-off assets.

## Expose Only What You Need (Especially in `.mogrt`)

If using `.mogrt`, keep the Essential Graphics panel **lean and intentional**:

- Don’t expose unused controls
- Rename each property for clarity
- Avoid overly nested structures

## Reuse Templates with Job-Level Overrides

Instead of creating dozens of near-identical templates:

- Design **modular templates** that accept asset input
- Use job payloads to swap:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Colors
  - Voiceover / audio
  - Fonts

> One clean template can power hundreds of job variants via automation.

## Clean Up Before Export

Before finalizing your `.aep` or `.mogrt`:

- Remove unused compositions and precomps
- Purge unreferenced assets (File → Dependencies → Remove Unused Footage)
- Reduce media to only what is needed
- Name all dynamic layers clearly
- Preview render in After Effects to catch broken expressions or fonts

## Version Your Templates

Use `displayName` consistently across template versions:

| Display Name            | Notes                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `product-demo-v1`       | Initial rollout             |
| `product-demo-v2-fixed` | Bugfix for font issues      |
| `product-demo-v3`       | Updated to new brand colors |

This helps your team stay organized and avoid breaking changes.

## Validate Before Launching Jobs at Scale

Before integrating a template into production automation:

- Manually render with test data
- Validate composition names
- Validate all layer overrides using `GET /template/:id`
- Try preview rendering (`preview: true`) in jobs if needed

Following these practices helps ensure your renders are:

- **Repeatable**
- **Scalable**
- **Debuggable**
- **Designer- and dev-friendly**
