Before uploading your project files, you need to **create a template object** using the Nexrender Cloud API. This tells the system:

- What type of template you're going to upload (`aep`, `zip`, or `mogrt`)
- How to label this template for your internal reference

You can register new AE templates via the [POST /templates](/api#post-/templates) API endpoint.


**Fields Breakdown**

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `type`        | string | ✅        | One of: `aep`, `zip`, or `mogrt`     |
| `displayName` | string | ✅        | Human-readable name for the template |

> Choose `type: "zip"` if your template is a `.aep` file bundled with assets and fonts.\
> Use `type: "mogrt"` only for raw `.mogrt` files exported from After Effects.

<Note>
  This step returns an uploadInfo object that contains a pre-signed upload URL for securely uploading your file in the next step.
</Note>

### Required Headers

The following headers must be present if included in the `uploadInfo.fields` object:

| Header            | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Type      | Usually `application/octet-stream`             |
| x-amz-meta-custom | May be included for tracking template ID       |
| Content-Length    | Set automatically by `curl` or Postman         |
| Content-Encoding  | Usually not required; use `identity` if needed |

> Do not change the upload URL, append query params, or add any extra headers.

### Postman Configuration

To upload via Postman:

- **Method**: `PUT`
- **URL**: Use the full `uploadInfo.url` from the API
- **Auth**: No Auth
- **Body**: Set to `binary`, and select your file
- **Header**: Manually set `Content-Type` to `application/octet-stream`

Make sure Postman does **not** automatically add:

- `Authorization`
- `Accept`
- `User-Agent`
- Any `x-amz-*` headers not explicitly required

These can invalidate the signature and result in a `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` error.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- The backend **reserves storage** for your file
- Generates a **secure upload URL** valid for ~1 hour
- Waits for the actual file to be uploaded (in the next step)
- The template status is initially set to `awaiting_upload`

You **must upload the correct file** matching the declared `type` — otherwise the introspection process will fail.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                                | Result                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Declaring `type: zip` but uploading `.aep` or `.mogrt` | The render job will fail or silently break asset resolution |
| Uploading to the wrong URL                             | The template will remain in `awaiting_upload` status        |
| Forgetting to use the pre-signed URL                   | You'll get a 403 Forbidden error or SignatureDoesNotMatch   |

Once the upload is complete, the status will transition to `uploaded`, and Nexrender Cloud will extract all available compositions and dynamic layers.
