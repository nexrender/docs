Before uploading your project files, you need to **create a template object** using the Nexrender Cloud API. This tells the system:

- What type of template you're going to upload (`aep`, `zip`, or `mogrt`)
- How to label this template for your internal reference

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- The backend **reserves storage** for your file
- Generates a **secure upload URL** valid for ~1 hour
- Waits for the actual file to be uploaded (in the next step)
- The template status is initially set to `awaiting_upload`

You **must upload the correct file** matching the declared `type` â€” otherwise the introspection process will fail.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                                | Result                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Declaring `type: zip` but uploading `.aep` or `.mogrt` | The render job will fail or silently break asset resolution |
| Uploading to the wrong URL                             | The template will remain in `awaiting_upload` status        |
| Forgetting to use the pre-signed URL                   | You'll get a 403 Forbidden error or SignatureDoesNotMatch   |

Once the upload is complete, the status will transition to `uploaded`, and Nexrender Cloud will extract all available compositions and dynamic layers.
