## What is a Template in Nexrender Cloud?

In Nexrender Cloud, a **template** is an After Effects project file (or compatible format) uploaded to the cloud and registered with metadata, enabling dynamic rendering and automation at scale.

Templates are the foundation for all render jobs. Once uploaded and processed, Nexrender Cloud can introspect the file to extract:

- **Available compositions** (e.g., `main`, `intro`, `outro`)
- **Editable layers** (text, images, audio, video)
- And render any of them dynamically based on incoming asset data.

### Supported Template Formats

| Format   | Description                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.aep`   | Native Adobe After Effects project file                          |
| `.zip`   | A `.aep` file bundled with its assets (images, videos, fonts)    |
| `.mogrt` | Motion Graphics Template exported from AE, for use in Adobe apps |

We recommend `.zip` as the **most flexible and robust** format for complex workflows. It allows bundling everything together in one archive: project, assets, fonts, and expressions.

### Why Use `.zip` Instead of Raw `.aep`?

- **Portable**: All dependencies are included in the archive
- **Stable**: Avoids asset path resolution issues on render nodes
- **Versionable**: Can be zipped and reused reliably in CI/CD pipelines
- **Flexible**: Supports preloading fonts, media, nested comps, scripts

> For `.mogrt` templates, you can upload them directly without zipping.

### 💡 Why Use `.mogrt` Templates with Nexrender Cloud?

`.mogrt` (Motion Graphics Template) files are a streamlined way to automate rich, branded animations with Nexrender Cloud — without requiring a complex `.aep` project structure.

Created directly from Adobe After Effects via the **Essential Graphics panel**, these templates allow designers to expose just the fields needed for dynamic automation: text, images, colors, sliders, audio, and more.

#### Benefits of `.mogrt` with Nexrender

| Feature                        | Why It Matters in Nexrender Automation                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Simplified integration**     | Upload directly via API — no need to bundle assets, no zip required      |
| **Designer-controlled inputs** | Fields defined in AE become JSON-editable params in Nexrender jobs       |
| **Low-maintenance**            | No manual layer mapping or fragile expression parsing                    |
| **Fast introspection**         | Nexrender automatically extracts editable parameters on upload           |
| **Lightweight & portable**     | Ideal for workflows requiring rapid rendering and high volume throughput |

#### Best Use Cases in Nexrender Cloud

- **API-driven personalization** of short-form branded videos
- **Ad creatives** with dynamic messaging and visuals
- **Onboarding or tutorial clips** where only text or logos change
- **Mass rendering jobs** for social media, product launches, or app stores

#### Nexrender Internals

When you upload a `.mogrt` template via the API:

- Nexrender parses the file immediately using the embedded JSON schema
- All editable fields are exposed under the `layers` property
- The system automatically handles validation and rendering logic
- No additional scripting or manual post-processing is required

> Nexrender treats `.mogrt` files as first-class citizens in its rendering pipeline. You get the same scalability and real-time tracking as with `.zip`-based templates — with less configuration.

### How Nexrender Uses Templates Internally

Once a template is uploaded via the API, the backend performs **introspection**:

- Validates the file type
- Extracts a list of compositions and editable layer properties
- Stores metadata under a unique template ID
- Returns a presigned `uploadInfo.url` (valid for 1 hour) to upload the actual file

Once the file is uploaded, the status changes to `uploaded`, and you can start submitting render jobs that reference this template by ID.

### Typical Template Lifecycle

1. **Create** the template (`POST /api/v2/templates`) with a `type` and `displayName`
2. **Upload** the actual file to `uploadInfo.url` (no auth headers\!)
3. **Confirm** the status is `uploaded`
4. **Inspect** the template to see available `compositions` and `layers`
5. **Submit** render jobs that reference the template

## Step 1: Register a Template

Before uploading your file, you need to **create a template object** using the Nexrender Cloud API. This tells the system:

- What type of template you're going to upload (`aep`, `zip`, or `mogrt`)
- How to label this template for your internal reference

This step returns an `uploadInfo` object that contains a **pre-signed upload URL** for securely uploading your file in the next step.

### Endpoint

```
POST /api/v2/templates
```

### Request Payload

```json
{
  "type": "zip",
  "displayName": "Promo 2024 Campaign"
}
```

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `type`        | string | ✅        | One of: `aep`, `zip`, or `mogrt`     |
| `displayName` | string | ✅        | Human-readable name for the template |

> Choose `type: "zip"` if your template is a `.aep` file bundled with assets and fonts.\
> Use `type: "mogrt"` only for raw `.mogrt` files exported from After Effects.

---

### Example `curl` Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "zip",
    "displayName": "Promo 2024 Campaign"
  }'
```

---

### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "template": {
    "id": "01JT2M9GCR712V7EJYDF45QAFD",
    "type": "zip",
    "displayName": "Promo 2024 Campaign",
    "status": "awaiting_upload",
    "createdAt": "2025-05-05T16:25:59.961Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-05-05T16:25:59.961Z",
    "compositions": [],
    "layers": [],
    "mogrt": {}
  },
  "uploadInfo": {
    "url": "https://nx1-assets-eu.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/...signed_url...",
    "method": "PUT",
    "fields": {
      "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream",
      "x-amz-meta-custom": "{\"templateId\":\"01JT2M9GCR712V7EJYDF45QAFD\"}"
    },
    "expiresIn": 3600,
    "key": "01JTGK.../templates/Promo2024.zip"
  }
}
```

---

### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- The backend **reserves storage** for your file
- Generates a **secure upload URL** valid for ~1 hour
- Waits for the actual file to be uploaded (in the next step)
- The template status is initially set to `awaiting_upload`

You **must upload the correct file** matching the declared `type` — otherwise the introspection process will fail.

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                                | Result                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Declaring `type: zip` but uploading `.aep` or `.mogrt` | The render job will fail or silently break asset resolution |
| Uploading to the wrong URL                             | The template will remain in `awaiting_upload` status        |
| Forgetting to use the pre-signed URL                   | You’ll get a 403 Forbidden error or SignatureDoesNotMatch   |

Once the upload is complete, the status will transition to `uploaded`, and Nexrender Cloud will extract all available compositions and dynamic layers.

---

Ready to upload the file? [Continue to Step 2 →](#step-2-upload-the-ae-file)

## Step 2: Upload the AE File

Once your template is registered and you’ve received the `uploadInfo.url`, the next step is to upload the actual After Effects file.

This file must match the format you declared when creating the template: either `.aep`, `.zip`, or `.mogrt`.

---

### Where to Upload

The `uploadInfo.url` returned in the response is a **presigned URL** — a time-limited link that allows you to upload the file without any additional authentication.

The method is always `PUT`, and you must include the correct headers exactly as provided in the `uploadInfo.fields`.

---

### Example `curl` Upload Request

```bash
curl --location --request PUT \
  'https://your-upload-url-from-uploadInfo.url' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
  --data-binary '@/path/to/your/project.zip'
```

You can replace `.zip` with `.aep` or `.mogrt` depending on your workflow.

---

### Example Success Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

---

### Required Headers

The following headers must be present if included in the `uploadInfo.fields` object:

| Header            | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Type      | Usually `application/octet-stream`             |
| x-amz-meta-custom | May be included for tracking template ID       |
| Content-Length    | Set automatically by `curl` or Postman         |
| Content-Encoding  | Usually not required; use `identity` if needed |

> Do not change the upload URL, append query params, or add any extra headers.

---

### Postman Configuration (If Not Using curl)

To upload via Postman:

- **Method**: `PUT`
- **URL**: Use the full `uploadInfo.url` from the API
- **Auth**: No Auth
- **Body**: Set to `binary`, and select your file
- **Header**: Manually set `Content-Type` to `application/octet-stream`

Make sure Postman does **not** automatically add:

- `Authorization`
- `Accept`
- `User-Agent`
- Any `x-amz-*` headers not explicitly required

These can invalidate the signature and result in a `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` error.

---

### ⚠️ Important: Upload the Correct File Type

The file you upload must match the `type` field you declared during template creation:

| Declared `type` | Expected File Upload |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| `zip`           | `project.zip`        |
| `aep`           | `project.aep`        |
| `mogrt`         | `project.mogrt`      |

If you upload the wrong file type, the template introspection will fail, and you won’t be able to render from it.

---

### Template Status: `uploaded`

Once the upload completes, the template's `status` will change from `awaiting_upload` to `uploaded`. At this point, Nexrender Cloud will:

- Extract all available **compositions**
- Parse editable **layers** for use in jobs
- Make the template immediately available for rendering

You can fetch the template object via:

```bash
curl https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This will return metadata including compositions and layers.

---

## Step 3: Confirm Status

Once your template file is uploaded, Nexrender Cloud processes it in the background.

You must confirm that the template has transitioned from:

```
awaiting_upload → uploaded
```

Only then will you be able to submit render jobs based on it.

---

### Check Template Status

To check the current status of your template, make a `GET` request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `TEMPLATE_ID` with the ID returned during Step 1.

---

### Example Successful Response

```json
{
  "id": "01JT2M9GCR712V7EJYDF45QAFD",
  "type": "zip",
  "status": "uploaded",
  "displayName": "Promo 2024 Campaign",
  "createdAt": "2025-05-05T16:25:59.961Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-05-05T16:30:01.015Z",
  "compositions": ["main", "intro", "outro"],
  "layers": [
    {
      "layerName": "title",
      "property": "Source Text",
      "type": "data"
    },
    {
      "layerName": "subtitle",
      "property": "Source Text",
      "type": "data"
    },
    {
      "layerName": "logo",
      "property": "Source Name",
      "type": "image"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔍 Key Fields to Inspect

| Field          | Description                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`       | Should be `uploaded`. Any other status means you can't render yet.         |
| `compositions` | List of named compositions in the AE project. You must pick one to render. |
| `layers`       | List of dynamic layers you can override with asset injection.              |

---

### ❌ If `status` ≠ `uploaded`

If the template remains in `awaiting_upload` or shows an error status:

1. Check that you **uploaded the correct file type** (`zip`, `aep`, or `mogrt`)
2. Ensure the file was uploaded to the **`exact uploadInfo.url`**
3. Inspect logs or contact support if rendering infrastructure couldn’t process the file

> You cannot submit a render job until the template is fully uploaded and parsed.

---

### Example: Fetching Layers for a Render Job

You’ll use the `layerName` and `property` fields when constructing your job payload:

```json
{
  "template": {
    "id": "TEMPLATE_ID",
    "composition": "main"
  },
  "assets": [
    {
      "type": "data",
      "layerName": "title",
      "property": "Source Text",
      "value": "My Dynamic Title"
    },
    {
      "type": "image",
      "layerName": "logo",
      "property": "Source Name",
      "src": "https://example.com/yourlogo.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Step 5: Optional – Fonts & Dependencies

If your After Effects project uses **custom fonts**, you’ll need to preload them into Nexrender Cloud before rendering — otherwise the render nodes may fallback to system fonts or fail altogether.

---

### Why Fonts Must Be Preloaded

Cloud render environments do not have access to your local machine’s fonts.

To maintain design fidelity and brand consistency, Nexrender Cloud provides a way to **`upload and persist .ttf font files`** in your account, which will be automatically loaded before rendering.

---

### Supported Font Formats

| Format | Description               |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| `.ttf` | TrueType Font (preferred) |
| `.otf` | Not currently supported   |

---

### How to Upload Fonts

You can upload fonts via the Fonts API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/Roboto-Regular.ttf"
```

---

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": "font-roboto-regular",
  "filename": "Roboto-Regular.ttf",
  "status": "ready",
  "size": 142384
}
```

Once uploaded, fonts are available to all future render jobs, no additional steps required.

---

### How Nexrender Loads Fonts

- Fonts are installed before After Effects launches
- Fonts persist across render jobs in the cloud
- If a font is missing, AE will silently fallback — which can cause layout bugs

> **Always preload** any custom font that’s not part of Adobe’s base installation.

## Step 6: Best Practices for Template Management

Creating reliable, scalable templates for Nexrender Cloud isn’t just about making them render — it’s about making them **repeatable**, **debuggable**, and **collaboration-friendly**.

Here are the key principles we recommend.

---

### Structure Your Template Archives Carefully

For `.zip` templates:

- Keep the structure **flat** — no top-level folders
- Ensure all assets (images, audio, etc.) are inside the archive
- Place the `.aep` file at the root level of the archive

```text
project.zip
├── MyTemplate.aep
├── assets/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── audio.mp3
```

> This avoids asset path issues and guarantees cross-platform portability.

---

### Name Layers and Compositions Intelligently

Clear naming of layers and compositions directly improves automation accuracy, debuggability, and developer handoff. Treat your `.aep` or `.mogrt` like a codebase — the structure matters.

#### Layer Naming Rules

| Layer Attribute       | Best Practice                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `layerName`           | Use lowercase, short identifiers (`title`, `cta`)   |
| `property`            | Match AE's label exactly (`Source Text`, `Opacity`) |
| Avoid duplicates      | Ensure no two layers in the same comp share a name  |
| Use descriptive types | e.g. `product_image`, `voiceover`, `cta_background` |

> Nexrender requires exact `layerName` matches during job execution. Ambiguity or typos will cause silent render errors or broken outputs.

#### Composition Naming Rules

| Composition Type    | Suggested Naming                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Main output comp    | `main`, `final`, `output`, etc.      |
| Variants            | `main_1080p`, `main_instagram`, etc. |
| Reusable partials   | `cta_module`, `intro_block`, etc.    |
| Discarded or hidden | Prefix with `_` (e.g. `_scratchpad`) |

This ensures the `compositions` list returned by the API is clean, predictable, and renderable.

---

### Nested Compositions: Best Practices

Nested comps are a powerful After Effects feature, but you must use them carefully for cloud automation:

#### Use Nested Comps To:

- Group logic-heavy modules (e.g. transitions, intro bumpers)
- Encapsulate reusable visual elements (e.g. buttons, tickers)
- Reduce clutter in the main timeline

#### Avoid Nested Comps If:

- They rely on hard-coded paths or relative asset placement
- They contain dynamic layers you intend to override
- You have deeply nested timelines (\>3 levels) — this can increase AE processing time and complicate debugging

> Keep nested comps clean, flattened when possible, and **treat the top-level comp as your automation interface**.

---

### Preview Rendering With Dummy Data

Before deploying a template at scale:

- Create a test job with fake but realistic values
- Set `"preview": true` to get a fast low-res render
- Check for missing fonts, broken text, or incorrect layout sizing

This helps catch structural and naming bugs early, especially with deeply nested templates.

---

### Summary: Think Like a Developer \+ Designer

Design with **automation-first principles**:

- Expose only what needs to be dynamic
- Use naming conventions for predictability
- Keep timelines shallow, modular, and reusable
- Organize assets logically inside the project and `.zip`

This makes your After Effects templates act like **parameterized functions**, not fragile, one-off assets.

---

### Expose Only What You Need (Especially in `.mogrt`)

If using `.mogrt`, keep the Essential Graphics panel **lean and intentional**:

- Don’t expose unused controls
- Rename each property for clarity
- Avoid overly nested structures

---

### Reuse Templates with Job-Level Overrides

Instead of creating dozens of near-identical templates:

- Design **modular templates** that accept asset input
- Use job payloads to swap:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Colors
  - Voiceover / audio
  - Fonts

> One clean template can power hundreds of job variants via automation.

---

### Clean Up Before Export

Before finalizing your `.aep` or `.mogrt`:

- Remove unused compositions and precomps
- Purge unreferenced assets (File → Dependencies → Remove Unused Footage)
- Reduce media to only what is needed
- Name all dynamic layers clearly
- Preview render in After Effects to catch broken expressions or fonts

---

### Version Your Templates

Use `displayName` consistently across template versions:

| Display Name            | Notes                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `product-demo-v1`       | Initial rollout             |
| `product-demo-v2-fixed` | Bugfix for font issues      |
| `product-demo-v3`       | Updated to new brand colors |

This helps your team stay organized and avoid breaking changes.

---

### Validate Before Launching Jobs at Scale

Before integrating a template into production automation:

- Manually render with test data
- Validate composition names
- Validate all layer overrides using `GET /template/:id`
- Try preview rendering (`preview: true`) in jobs if needed

---

Following these practices helps ensure your renders are:

- **Repeatable**
- **Scalable**
- **Debuggable**
- **Designer- and dev-friendly**
