  <Step title="Upload the AE File">
    Once your template is registered and you’ve received the `uploadInfo.url`, the next step is to upload the actual After Effects file.

    This file must match the format you declared when creating the template: either `.aep`, `.zip`, or `.mogrt`.

    ---

    <Accordion title="Where to Upload">
      The `uploadInfo.url` returned in the response is a **presigned URL** — a time-limited link that allows you to upload the file without any additional authentication.

      The method is always `PUT`, and you must include the correct headers exactly as provided in the `uploadInfo.fields`.
    </Accordion>
    ---

    ### Example `curl` Upload Request

    You can replace `.zip` with `.aep` or `.mogrt` depending on your workflow.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Template File Upload Request
    curl --location --request PUT \
      'https://your-upload-url-from-uploadInfo.url' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
      --data-binary '@/path/to/your/project.zip'
    ```

    
    ```http Example Success Response
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="
      <Accordion title="Template Status: `uploaded`">
        Once the upload completes, the template's `status` will change from `awaiting_upload` to `uploaded`. At this point, Nexrender Cloud will:

        - Extract all available **compositions**
        - Parse editable **layers** for use in jobs
        - Make the template immediately available for rendering

        You can fetch the template object via:

        ```bash
        curl https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        ```

        This will return metadata including compositions and layers.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Status">
    Once your template file is uploaded, Nexrender Cloud processes it in the background.

    You must confirm that the template has transitioned from:

    ```
    awaiting_upload → uploaded
    ```

    Only then will you be able to submit render jobs based on it.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Check Template Status">
        To check the current status of your template, make a `GET` request. Replace `TEMPLATE_ID` with the ID returned during Step 1.

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash Check Template Status
        curl -X GET https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        ```

        
        ```json Example Successful Response

        | Field          | Description                                                                |
        | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `status`       | Should be `uploaded`. Any other status means you can't render yet.         |
        | `compositions` | List of named compositions in the AE project. You must pick one to render. |
        | `layers`       | List of dynamic layers you can override with asset injection.              |
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="If `status` ≠ `uploaded`">
        If the template remains in `awaiting_upload` or shows an error status:

        1. Check that you **uploaded the correct file type** (`zip`, `aep`, or `mogrt`)
        2. Ensure the file was uploaded to the **`exact uploadInfo.url`**
        3. Inspect logs or contact support if rendering infrastructure couldn’t process the file

        > You cannot submit a render job until the template is fully uploaded and parsed.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Fetching Layers for a Render Job">
        You’ll use the `layerName` and `property` fields when constructing your job payload:

        ```json
        {
          "template": {
            "id": "TEMPLATE_ID",
            "composition": "main"

  <Step title="Optional – Fonts & Dependencies">
    If your After Effects project uses **custom fonts**, you’ll need to preload them into Nexrender Cloud before rendering — otherwise the render nodes may fallback to system fonts or fail altogether.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Why Fonts Must Be Preloaded">
        Cloud render environments do not have access to your local machine’s fonts.

        To maintain design fidelity and brand consistency, Nexrender Cloud provides a way to **`upload and persist .ttf font files`** in your account, which will be automatically loaded before rendering.

        ### Supported Font Formats

        | Format | Description               |
        | ------ | ------------------------- |
        | `.ttf` | TrueType Font (preferred) |
        | `.otf` | Not currently supported   |
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How to Upload Fonts">
        You can upload fonts via the Fonts API:

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash Upload Font
        curl -X POST https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
          -F "file=@/path/to/Roboto-Regular.ttf"
        ```

        
        ```json Example Response
        {
          "id": "font-roboto-regular",
          "filename": "Roboto-Regular.ttf",
          "status": "ready",
          "size": 142384
        }
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        Once uploaded, fonts are available to all future render jobs, no additional steps required.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="How Nexrender Loads Fonts">
        - Fonts are installed before After Effects launches
        - Fonts persist across render jobs in the cloud
        - If a font is missing, AE will silently fallback — which can cause layout bugs

        > **Always preload** any custom font that’s not part of Adobe’s base installation.
