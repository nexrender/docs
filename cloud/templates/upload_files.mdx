Once your template is registered and you’ve received the `uploadInfo.url`, the next step is to upload the actual After Effects file.

This file must match the format you declared when creating the template: either `.aep`, `.zip`, or `.mogrt`.

### Where to Upload

The `uploadInfo.url` returned in the response is a **presigned URL** — a time-limited link that allows you to upload the file without any additional authentication.

The method is always `PUT`, and you must include the correct headers exactly as provided in the `uploadInfo.fields`.

#### Example `curl` Upload Request

You can replace `.zip` with `.aep` or `.mogrt` depending on your workflow.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Template File Upload Request
curl --location --request PUT \
  'https://your-upload-url-from-uploadInfo.url' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
  --data-binary '@/path/to/your/project.zip'
```


```http Example Success Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Required Headers

The following headers must be present if included in the `uploadInfo.fields` object:

| Header            | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Type      | Usually `application/octet-stream`             |
| x-amz-meta-custom | May be included for tracking template ID       |
| Content-Length    | Set automatically by `curl` or Postman         |
| Content-Encoding  | Usually not required; use `identity` if needed |

> Do not change the upload URL, append query params, or add any extra headers.

#### Postman Configuration (If Not Using curl)

To upload via Postman:

- **Method**: `PUT`
- **URL**: Use the full `uploadInfo.url` from the API
- **Auth**: No Auth
- **Body**: Set to `binary`, and select your file
- **Header**: Manually set `Content-Type` to `application/octet-stream`

Make sure Postman does **not** automatically add:

- `Authorization`
- `Accept`
- `User-Agent`
- Any `x-amz-*` headers not explicitly required

These can invalidate the signature and result in a `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` error.

#### Important: Upload the Correct File Type

The file you upload must match the `type` field you declared during template creation:

| Declared `type` | Expected File Upload |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| `zip`           | `project.zip`        |
| `aep`           | `project.aep`        |
| `mogrt`         | `project.mogrt`      |

If you upload the wrong file type, the template introspection will fail, and you won’t be able to render from it.

### Confirming Template Upload Status

Once the upload completes, the template's `status` will change from `awaiting_upload` to `uploaded`. At this point, Nexrender Cloud will:

- Extract all available **compositions**
- Parse editable **layers** for use in jobs
- Make the template immediately available for rendering

You can fetch the template object via:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Curl Request
curl https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/templates/TEMPLATE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
