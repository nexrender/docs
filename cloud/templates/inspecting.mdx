This guide explains how to **list**, **fetch**, **update**, and (eventually) **organize** your After Effects templates in Nexrender Cloud.
 
  ## Template Storage & Retention
    Templates are currently persisted indefinitely unless deleted manually.

    In future versions of Nexrender Cloud, you may be able to:

    - Define auto-expiry dates for templates
    - Set retention policies (e.g. delete after 30 days of inactivity)
    - Audit unused templates to manage storage

    For now:

    - Use `GET /templates` to review active templates
    - Regularly delete old or unused templates after campaigns
