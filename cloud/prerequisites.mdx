### Preparing Template Files

#### Archiving Correctly
    To ensure your `.zip` template works properly in Nexrender Cloud, make sure the archive is structured **flat**, with no extra subfolder wrapping the project. There are two options:

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.tella.tv/video/cmc1uxp3e00100bl1782k9880/embed?b=1&title=1&a=1&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=1"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Option 1: Zip Correctly via Finder (GUI)">
      
        If you prefer using the graphical interface:

        1. **Open the folder** that contains your `.aep` and asset folders.
        2. **Select all items inside** (Command ⌘ \+ A).
        3. Right-click the selected files and choose **"Compress X Items"**.
        4. This will create an archive named `Archive.zip` with the correct structure.
        5. Rename it to `project.zip`.

        <video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src=https://www.tella.tv/video/cmc1uxp3e00100bl1782k9880/embed?b=1&title=1&a=1&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=1"
></video>

        <Note>
          **Do not compress the parent folder itself** — always compress the files inside the folder.
        </Note>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Option 2: Zip Correctly via Terminal (Advanced)">
        1. Open **Terminal**
        2. Navigate to your project folder:

           ```bash
           cd /path/to/MyProjectFolder
           ```
        3. Create the zip **from inside the folder**:

           ```bash
           zip -r ../project.zip ./*
           ```

        <Note>
          This will include only the contents of the folder, not the folder itself.
        </Note>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
  #### Correct `.zip` Archive Structure
      The root of the archive should contain the `.aep` file, plus any asset folders (e.g. images, fonts, videos):

      ```
      project.zip
      ├── MyProject.aep
      ├── assets/
      │   ├── image.jpg
      │   ├── audio.mp3
      └── ...
      ```


  #### Preparing `.mogrt` Templates
    If you're using a `.mogrt` file:

    - You **do not need to zip it**
    - Just upload the raw `.mogrt` file directly via the presigned URL

    > For best results, unzip your archive before uploading and confirm the `.aep` file is located at the root level (not buried inside a folder).

  #### Common Mistake on macOS
    If you right-click a folder and choose **"Compress"**, macOS will zip the entire folder and include it as a top-level directory:

    ```
    project.zip
    └── MyProjectFolder/
        ├── MyProject.aep
        └── assets/
    ```

    <Note>
      This extra folder layer will break relative file paths inside After Effects, causing missing asset errors or silent render failures.
    </Note>
