## Basics

- An active Nexrender Cloud account - [Ping Us](https://www.nexrender.com/contact) if you don't have one
- Your API Key (grab it from your dashboard) - [API Key](https://app.nexrender.com/team/settings)
- A valid After Effects template in `.aep`, `.zip`, or `.mogrt` format with assets and fonts
- Custom fonts in TTF format

## Archiving Your Project Correctly

To ensure your `.zip` template works properly in Nexrender Cloud, make sure the archive is structured **flat**, with no extra subfolder wrapping the project. There are two options:

  <Tab title="Option 1: Zip Correctly via Finder">
    <img
      height="200"
      src="https://nx-website-assets.nexrender.com/archiving.gif"
    />

    If you prefer using the graphical interface:

    1. **Open the folder** that contains your `.aep` and asset folders.
    2. **Select all items inside** (Command ⌘ \+ A).
    3. Right-click the selected files and choose **"Compress X Items"**.
    4. This will create an archive named `Archive.zip` with the correct structure.
    5. Rename it to `project.zip`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2: Zip Correctly via Terminal">
    1. Open **Terminal**
    2. Navigate to your project folder:

       ```bash
       cd /path/to/MyProjectFolder
       ```
    3. Create the zip **from inside the folder**:

       ```bash
       zip -r ../project.zip ./*
       ```

    <Note>
      This will include only the contents of the folder, not the folder itself.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Correct `.zip` Archive Structure

The root of the archive should contain the `.aep` file, plus any asset folders (e.g. images, fonts, videos):

```
project.zip
├── MyProject.aep
├── assets/
│   ├── image.jpg
│   ├── audio.mp3
└── ...
```

### Common Mistake on macOS

If you right-click a folder and choose **"Compress"**, macOS will zip the entire folder and include it as a top-level directory:

```
project.zip
└── MyProjectFolder/
    ├── MyProject.aep
    └── assets/
```

<Note>
  This extra folder layer will break relative file paths inside After Effects, causing missing asset errors or silent render failures.
</Note>

## Preparing `.mogrt` Templates

If you're using a `.mogrt` file:

- You **do not need to zip it**
- Just upload the raw `.mogrt` file directly via the presigned URL

> For best results, unzip your archive before uploading and confirm the `.aep` file is located at the root level (not buried inside a folder).
