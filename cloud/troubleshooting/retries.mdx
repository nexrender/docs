# Retry Logic

Nexrender Cloud is built to be resilient. It includes several forms of automatic retries to handle temporary network errors, webhook delivery issues, and storage problems. This guide explains where retries occur and how to design for them.

---

## Webhook Retry Behavior

If your webhook endpoint is unreachable or returns a non-2xx status code, Nexrender Cloud will retry delivery **up to 3 times**.

### Retry Pattern:

- Attempt 1: Immediately
- Retry 1: ~30 seconds later
- Retry 2: ~90 seconds later
- Retry 3: ~180 seconds later

> Total delivery window: ~5 minutes

### Tips:
- Always return `200 OK` quickly (queue work internally)
- Make your handler idempotent — retries should not duplicate logic
- Log incoming requests with job ID and status

---

## Upload Failures

Uploads via `uploadInfo.url` are one-time, pre-signed `PUT` operations. These are **not retried** by Nexrender Cloud.

### Best Practices:
- Use curl/Postman with correct headers
- Watch for `403 Forbidden` (bad headers or expired URL)
- Re-create the template if needed

---

## Rendering Retries

Renders may occasionally fail due to:
- Crash inside After Effects
- Missing fonts or broken scripts
- Download timeout for assets

Some of these failures are retried **once** automatically, depending on the failure class.

### Guaranteed Retry Cases:
- Transient node errors (e.g. out-of-memory)
- CDN timeouts for asset URLs

### Not Retried:
- Broken AE templates
- Invalid `layerName` or `composition`
- Expression crashes or font not found

---

##  Handling Errors on Your Side

You can safely retry a job **on your own** by resubmitting the same job payload if:
- The job failed (`status: failed`)
- The root cause has been fixed (e.g. font uploaded, typo corrected)

You do not need to delete or mutate the original job. Just create a new one with the same template ID and assets.

> Consider tagging failed jobs or logging them for reprocessing queues.

##  Summary

| Retry Target     | Automatic? | Max Attempts | Notes                             |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Webhooks         | ✅ Yes      | 3            | With exponential backoff          |
| File Upload      | ❌ No       | 0            | Client-managed                    |
| Rendering Node   | ✅ Sometimes| 1 (if retryable) | Only for recoverable failures |
| Manual Job Retry | Manual     | Unlimited    | Client decides when to resubmit   |
