# Rate Limits

To maintain service quality, Nexrender Cloud enforces API request limits. This page explains those limits and how to handle them correctly.

##  API Rate Limits

| Endpoint Group          | Limit (per minute) | Notes                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `POST /templates`       | 20 req/min         | Template creation                      |
| `PUT uploadInfo.url`    | Unlimited          | Direct file uploads go to storage CDN |
| `POST /jobs`            | 60 req/min         | Job creation requests                  |
| `GET /jobs/:id`         | 120 req/min        | Status polling                         |
| `GET /templates/:id`    | 100 req/min        | Layer introspection                    |

> Bursts beyond these values may result in 429 Too Many Requests.

## 429 Response Example

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again later.",
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT"
  }
}
```

When receiving 429s:
- Back off exponentially (e.g. wait 1s → 2s → 5s → 10s)
- Don't retry more than 3–5 times
- Queue jobs on your side instead of retry storming

---

## Best Practices

- Use [webhooks](../jobs/tracking) instead of polling
- Space out batch submissions using a queue
- Monitor your `429` rates — frequent limits may indicate misuse
- Avoid parallel retries from multiple systems
- Respect the retry headers when present
