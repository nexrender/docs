This section showcases technical patterns and workflows that help you scale Nexrender Cloud for real-world automation tasks — from batch rendering to personalized voiceovers.

## 1. Batch Rendering at Scale

If you need to render hundreds or thousands of video variants (e.g. for product catalogs, event invites, or localized ads), use this workflow.

### Step-by-Step

1. Prepare a `.aep` or `.mogrt` template with dynamic layers (text, images, audio)
2. Create a CSV, JSON, or database table with per-job data:

```json
[
  { "name": "Alice", "city": "Berlin" },
  { "name": "Bob", "city": "London" }
]
```

3. Write a script (Node.js or Python) to loop through records and:
   - POST a new job using the API
   - Replace layer values using the `assets` array

### Example Job Payload

```json
{
  "template": {
    "id": "TEMPLATE_ID",
    "composition": "main"
  },
  "assets": [
    {
      "type": "data",
      "layerName": "title",
      "property": "Source Text",
      "value": "Welcome Alice from Berlin!"
    }
  ],
  "webhook": { "url": "https://yourapi.com/status", "method": "POST" }
}
```

### Tips

- Throttle job creation (60/min max)
- Use tags or metadata to group related jobs
- Poll status or use webhooks to track completion

## 2. Adding TTS Voiceovers

You can dynamically synthesize speech and inject audio into a composition layer.

### Steps

1. Generate speech using an API like ElevenLabs or Google Cloud TTS
2. Store the audio file on a public or whitelisted URL
3. Add it as an `audio` asset in the job payload

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "src": "https://yourcdn.com/tts/voice1.mp3",
  "layerName": "Voiceover"
}
```

### Tips

- Sync duration and placement inside AE composition
- Use TTS engine options to vary pitch/speed
- Pre-generate and cache audio where possible

---

## 3. Personalized Titles and Text

Use asset injection to modify text dynamically per job.

### Example Asset

```json
{
  "type": "data",
  "layerName": "subtitle",
  "property": "Source Text",
  "value": "Your 2024 Recap is Ready!"
}
```

### Tips

- Use clear `layerName`s in your AE project
- Wrap expressions in AE to handle empty values:

```javascript
value !== "" ? value : "Default Text"
```

- Use `preview` mode during development
- Fonts must be preloaded via [Fonts API](../fonts/upload)

---

## Combine Them

You can combine all three patterns — injecting TTS, custom images, and batch metadata — to create:

- Automated onboarding videos
- Personalized wrap-ups or recaps
- Multilingual social content
