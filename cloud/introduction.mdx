Welcome to the official documentation for Nexrender Cloud – the hosted API-based solution for automating Adobe After Effects rendering at scale.

If you’re building personalized videos, automating ad creatives, or dynamically replacing content in .aep and .mogrt templates, Nexrender Cloud gives you a fast, scalable, zero-infrastructure way to do it.

## What is Nexrender Cloud?

Nexrender Cloud is a managed version of [Nexrender OSS](https://github.com/inlife/nexrender), designed for:

- Developers and automation workflows who want to submit render jobs programmatically and build video customization and rendering pipelines
- Studios and agencies who need batch rendering in the cloud with guaranteed reliability and broad customization capabilities
- Product teams that need frictionless video rendering and deep customization to power in-app experiences and branded content

Nexrender Cloud runs your rendering jobs using secure, pre-provisioned After Effects nodes with zero setup on your side.
