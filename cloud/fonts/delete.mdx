## Why Delete Fonts?
- Reduce clutter in your font list
- Avoid confusion from similarly named fonts
- Clean up test uploads or duplicates

Deleting fonts does **not** affect jobs that are already rendered. However, future jobs referencing that font may fail if it's not re-uploaded.

## Common Mistakes
  - Forgetting the `Authorization` header
  - Using a deleted or invalid font ID
  - Using `GET` instead of `DELETE`

## Best Practices
- Always list fonts first before deleting
- Ensure no active templates or teams rely on the font
- Rename and re-upload fonts instead of constantly deleting
