## Why Delete Fonts?

- Reduce clutter in your font list
- Avoid confusion from similarly named fonts
- Clean up test uploads or duplicates

Deleting fonts does **not** affect jobs that are already rendered. However, future jobs referencing that font may fail if it's not re-uploaded.

---

## Endpoint

```http
DELETE /api/v2/fonts/:id
```

You must provide the font ID from the listing endpoint.

---

### Example `curl`

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts/font-01JTX5VRSCK11DZ8AQT90F6BRP \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "deleted"
}
```

> Attempting to delete a nonexistent or unauthorized font will return a `404` or `403` error.

---

## Testing in Postman

1. Set method to `DELETE`
2. URL: `https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts/{FONT_ID}`
3. Add `Authorization` header
4. Send and confirm `status: deleted`

---

## Best Practices

- Always list fonts first before deleting
- Ensure no active templates or teams rely on the font
- Rename and re-upload fonts instead of constantly deleting
