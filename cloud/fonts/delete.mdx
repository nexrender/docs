## Why Delete Fonts?
- Reduce clutter in your font list
- Avoid confusion from similarly named fonts
- Clean up test uploads or duplicates

Deleting fonts does **not** affect jobs that are already rendered. However, future jobs referencing that font may fail if it's not re-uploaded.

## Deleting Fonts

You must provide the font ID from the listing endpoint.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Delete Font
curl -X DELETE https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts/font-01JTX5VRSCK11DZ8AQT90F6BRP \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```


```json Example Response
{
  "status": "deleted"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

> Attempting to delete a nonexistent or unauthorized font will return a `404` or `403` error.

## Testing in Postman"
### Step-by-step Instructions

  1. Set method to `DELETE`
  2. URL: `https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts/{FONT_ID}`
  3. Add `Authorization` header
  4. Send and confirm `status: deleted`

### Common Mistakes
  - Forgetting the `Authorization` header
  - Using a deleted or invalid font ID
  - Using `GET` instead of `DELETE`


## Best Practices
- Always list fonts first before deleting
- Ensure no active templates or teams rely on the font
- Rename and re-upload fonts instead of constantly deleting
