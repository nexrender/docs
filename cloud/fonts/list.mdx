Once you've uploaded fonts to your Nexrender Cloud account, you can list them to confirm their availability or debug font-related issues.

## How Fonts Are Matched

When rendering, Nexrender Cloud installs fonts based on:

- **Exact file name match** between After Effects project and uploaded `.ttf`
- Fonts are case-sensitive and must retain their original names

> AE uses the system-installed font name internally. To avoid mismatch, make sure your uploaded font’s file name matches what’s referenced in AE.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If your text layers render with wrong fonts or break, first check:
- That the font is uploaded and `status` is `available`
- That the file name (e.g. `OpenSans-Regular.ttf`) matches what AE expects
- That you don’t accidentally zip fonts inside your `.aep` or `.mogrt`
- Re-upload the font to resolve a corrupted or partial upload
