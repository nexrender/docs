## Why Upload Fonts?

After Effects needs fonts installed on the rendering system. If your project references a font that's not available, it will:

- Substitute with a fallback (causing layout bugs)
- Render incorrectly or silently fail
- Break dynamic layout/spacing in templates

## Supported Formats

Only `.ttf` (TrueType Font) files are currently supported.

## Font Matching Logic

When your AE project uses a font like `Roboto-Bold.ttf`, Nexrender Cloud will:

- Scan uploaded fonts for a filename match
- Install that font before rendering begins

You don't need to reference fonts explicitly in the render job â€” just make sure the font name and case match the one used in After Effects. 

When you are referencing the font in the render job, please make sure name is the same as for the uploaded font.


> You can check expected font filenames via `GET /templates/:id` if layer fonts are introspected.

## Best Practices

- Use **subset fonts** or stripped versions to reduce size
- Remove unused font weights/styles before upload
- Name fonts clearly (`OpenSans-Bold.ttf`, not `font1.ttf`)
- Keep naming consistent across AE and upload
