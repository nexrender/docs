## Why Upload Fonts?
After Effects needs fonts installed on the rendering system. If your project references a font that's not available, it will:

- Substitute with a fallback (causing layout bugs)
- Render incorrectly or silently fail
- Break dynamic layout/spacing in templates

## Supported Formats

Only `.ttf` (TrueType Font) files are currently supported.

## Uploading via API

Use the `POST /api/v2/fonts` endpoint with `multipart/form-data`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Upload Font
  curl -X POST https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -F "file=@/Users/you/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf"
```


```json Example Response
{
  "id": "font-01JT9XYZCDEF67GQ28P3KVB1RC",
  "fileName": "Roboto-Bold.ttf",
  "status": "available",
  "uploadedAt": "2025-05-14T11:00:00Z"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

> The `id` is optional — templates locate fonts by file name.
> See full details in the [API Reference →](POST /fonts)

## Upload via Postman

1. Set method to `POST`
2. Enter URL: `https://api.nexrender.com/api/v2/fonts`
3. Set `Authorization` header with your API key
4. Select **Body → form-data**:
   - Key: `file` (type = File)
   - Value: your `.ttf` file

Click **Send**, and you should see a `200 OK` with font metadata.

## Font Matching Logic

When your AE project uses a font like `Roboto-Bold.ttf`, Nexrender Cloud will:

- Scan uploaded fonts for a filename match
- Install that font before rendering begins

You don't need to reference fonts explicitly in the render job — just make sure the font name and case match the one used in After Effects.

> You can check expected font filenames via `GET /templates/:id` if layer fonts are introspected.

## Best Practices

- Use **subset fonts** or stripped versions to reduce size
- Remove unused font weights/styles before upload
- Name fonts clearly (`OpenSans-Bold.ttf`, not `font1.ttf`)
- Keep naming consistent across AE and upload
