### Job Scalability with Reserved Workers

We now support **reserved workers** — dedicated rendering nodes for teams requiring guaranteed performance. If all reserved nodes are busy, jobs automatically fall back to a shared, slower pool to ensure eventual processing without failure. _(Currently offered to selected clients.)_

### Job Parenting Logic Improved

Refactored internal logic for dependent/related jobs to better support future features like job chains and batches.

### Bug Fixes

Resolved 4 bugs related to job tracking and template rendering stability.

## April 2025

### Template Validation & Deep Parsing

Newly uploaded templates are now **automatically validated and introspected**. We extract key metadata:

- Available compositions
- Editable layers
- Embedded `.mogrt` parameters\
  This paves the way for advanced job setup via UI and API.

### Performance & Reliability Upgrades

Improved API throughput and reduced latency on template upload and font processing.

### Bug Fixes

Resolved 3 issues affecting asset rendering in edge cases.

## March 2025

### Jobs API v2 Launched

A completely new and powerful way to manage rendering jobs at scale.

**Key features:**

- Templates: reusable AEP/MOGRT/ZIP projects for rapid job issuing.
- Fonts: centralized font management — no need to host fonts externally.
- Smarter webhook handling, including **custom data payloads**.
- Clearer job lifecycle visibility: track, retry, and introspect with ease.
- Support for [`nx` asset functions] to control layers dynamically inside jobs.

## February 2025

### Job Redaction Layer

For privacy-conscious users, job data is now automatically **sanitized** after 3 days (render logs, asset paths, etc).

### Bug Fixes

Addressed 2 stability issues related to font uploads and job progress syncing.

## January 2025

### Dedicated API Service Migration

We’ve migrated all job-related operations to a separate service — this unlocks:

- Independent scaling
- Faster deploy cycles
- Greater reliability under load

### Foundational Optimizations

Major refactors behind the scenes: faster queueing, improved monitoring, and more resilient error recovery.
